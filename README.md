# Arduino Servo Control üöÄ

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This Arduino project allows you to control a servo motor using a button. By pressing the button, you can change the position of the servo motor between 80 and 120 degrees. This can be used for various applications such as controlling a robotic arm or a camera mount. Additionally, the project includes features like muting the string and recording the sound of the string at specific positions.
